#Inaugral Heroku UK User Group

I'm pleased to announced that the inaugral [Heroku][] UK meeting
will take place at [Skillsmatter][] on December 5th.

Registration is now open for the event [here][] - the talk descriptions
on the website will change a little bit between now and then. I'm going
to be doing a fly through of Heroku answering the why, what and hows.

Hopefully we'll have time for a Q&A session afterwards and also discuss
plans for the group as we appreciate that 'Heroku' is quite a broad
topic.
