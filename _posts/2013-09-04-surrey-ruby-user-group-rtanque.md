Something else I do is manage the [Surrey Ruby User
Group](http://twitter.com/surreyrubyists). We're a little way out of London but working at
[Kyan](http://kyan.com) I have good access to people willing to give
presentations - we don't attract numbers like the London Ruby User Group but
we're slowly growing and meeting regularly at the moment every 2 months or there
abouts.

However, lastnight was slightly different. We played
[RTanque](https://github.com/awilliams/RTanque). RTanque is a game for Rubyists
built using the Gosu 2D library to get a top down view on the action.

The idea is simple. Destory the other tanks! You build a tank in Ruby, you have access to sensors (radar)
and can control the direction of your tank and turret, speed of movement etc -
it's great fun and everyone had a great time, we held an elimation tournament to
start with before loading all the bots into a single arena for a death match.

Take a watch of the [DeathMatch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIFJ_3ibCPY) on
YouTube.
