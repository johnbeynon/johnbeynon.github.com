title: "Heroku iOS Management Applications"

There are a growing number of Heroku iOS applications coming out for managing
your Heroku applications. Nezumi, Iroku and more recently LovelyHeroku. Having
absolutely nothing to do one evening (when does that ever happen?) I sat down
and produced a comparison of the features that the 3 applications offer.

UPDATED: Take a look at my [comparison](/pdfs/ios_comparison_v1_1.pdf) - it's dated as 29
October 2013 (prices and feature set) and I may have missed some features or
incorrectly compared a feature - if I did,
it can't have been obvious enough how to perform the task in hand.

Boost were gracious enough to provide me with a free version of their
application. Thanks!

I'm not making judgements here, you can do that yourself.
